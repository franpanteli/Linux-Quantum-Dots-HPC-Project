# Linux-Quantum-Dots-Project
*Executive summary:*

This project is from a research internship I completed which used HPC to perform calculations in material science (geometry optimisation on quantum dots). This was my first in-depth introduction to Linux and involved 6 weeks of submitting and monitoring jobs to the Tier 2 HPC, Young.  The internship report I produced in this repository first introduces Indium Phosphide using condensed matter Physics nomenclature and then discusses results from calculations using the HPC facility. Further theory is then explored as an extension to this. A more technical abstract for this project is found in its internship report.
